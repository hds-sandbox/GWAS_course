    "After alignment and variant calling, genetic variation data is typically stored in formats like VCF and PLINK. While VCF is a detailed, text-based format, PLINK uses a more compact binary format that is faster and more efficient for large-scale analyses, such as GWAS. These formats are interchangeable, but we will focus on PLINK due to its common use and optimized performance for GWAS.\n",
    "\n",
    "When raw or genotype-level data is available, the genotyping parser extracts key information for each sample from the study annotation files, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Family ID\n",
    "* Sample ID\n",
    "* Paternal ID (for family-based studies)\n",
    "* Maternal ID (for family-based studies)\n",
    "* Sex\n",
    "* Phenotype (discrete or quantitative)\n",
    "* Group/cluster (eg, geographical region) to assess possible effects of population stratification\n",
    "\n",
    "The PLINK format consists of 3 different binary files: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `.bed`: a binary file containing genotype data.\n",
    "- `.bim`: plain text file information about each SNP in the dataset (chr, snpId, genetic position, alleles). The order of the SNPs is the same as in the bed file.\n",
    "- `.fam`: plain text file with information about the samples (family ID, individual ID, sex).\n",

    "\n",
    "To demonstrate all analysis steps with realistic genetic data, we will use a simulated dataset (N = 165) with a binary outcome measure, based on the publicly available data from the International HapMap Project [@gibbs_international_2003]. For this tutorial, we only included Utah residents with ancestry from Northern and Western Europe (CEU) to create an **ethnically homogenous** dataset. Because of the relatively small sample size of the HapMap data, genetic effect sizes in these simulations were set at values larger than usually observed in genetic studies of complex traits. It is important to note that larger sample sizes (e.g., at least in the order of thousands but likely even tens or hundreds of thousands) will be required to detect genetic risk factors of complex traits."
