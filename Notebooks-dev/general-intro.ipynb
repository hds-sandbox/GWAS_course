    "In this course, we will use JupyterLab, an open-source interactive development environment (IDE) for working with Jupyter Notebooks. If youâ€™re not familiar with this interface, check out the [JupyterLab Documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/overview.html).

To choose a kernel, go to the menu at the top of the page, select `Kernel --> Change Kernel`, and then select the preferred one.\n",

    "* You can run the code in each cell (grey background) by clicking the run cell sign in the toolbar, or simply by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>. When the code is done running, a small green check mark will appear on the left side.\n",
    "* You need to **run the cells sequentially** to execute the analysis. Please do not run a cell until the one above is done running, and do not skip any cells. \n",
    "* Textual descriptions accompany the code to help you understand what is happening. Please try not to focus on understanding the code itself in too much detail, but rather focus on the explanations and commands' output.  \n",
