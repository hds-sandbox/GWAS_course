It describes how allele and genotype frequencies are related, and that genetic variation can persist over multiple generations. Here, the historical origins and assumptions of the Hardy–Weinberg principle are described. Chi-square tests are used to find whether populations are at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, and departures from Hardy–Weinberg proportions can be due to genotyping error, non-random mating, natural selection, or other phenomena.},

	abstract = {Objective
              Genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) and their subsequent meta‐analyses have changed the landscape of genetics in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by uncovering several novel genes. Such studies are heavily weighted by samples from Caucasian populations, but they explain only a small proportion of total heritability. Our previous studies in genetically distinct North Indian RA cohorts have demonstrated apparent allelic/genetic heterogeneity between North Indian and Western populations, warranting GWAS in non‐European populations. We undertook this study to detect additional disease‐associated loci that may be collectively important in the presence or absence of genes with a major effect.
