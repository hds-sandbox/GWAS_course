    "While most individual associations found in GWAS studies are of small effect, information about them can be combined across the genome, to create a  **polygenic score (PGS)**. These scores can be used to make **genome-based predictions about the overall risk of having a particular trait or disease or about the genetic value for continuous traits**. If the prediction is on a discrete phenotype such as a disease, these scores are known as polygenic risk scores (PRS).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polygenic risk prediction analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "Single-variant association analysis has been the foundation of GWAS. However, detecting more than a handful of significant SNPs for many complex traits requires extremely large sample sizes. In contrast, PGS aggregate genetic risk across multiple variants into a single polygenic score for a given trait.\n",
    "\n",
    "A PGS is typically calculated by summing the allele frequencies of statistically significant trait-associated variants, weighted by their effect sizes, while ensuring independence among them (e.g., via LD pruning). These effect sizes—betas for continuous traits and log odds ratios for binary traits—are obtained from a discovery GWAS. Large discovery samples (also known as base or training samples) are needed for accurate estimates, but if the target sample shares ancestry, effect sizes from larger studies can be leveraged. A target sample of ~2,000 individuals may be sufficient to detect meaningful genetic contributions to trait variance [@dudbridge2013power]. For many complex traits, SNP effect sizes are publicly available (e.g., see https://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank, https://www.med.unc.edu/pgc/downloads or https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/).\n",
    "\n",
    "A common practice to calculate PRS involves clumping GWAS results using p-value thresholds (e.g., p < 0.05) to exclude poorly associated SNPs. Usually, multiple PRS analyses will be performed, with varying thresholds for the p-values of the association test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once PRS are calculated, they are used in (logistic) regression models to assess the contribution to the trait variance. Prediction accuracy is measured by the increase in $R^2$, comparing a baseline model with only covariates (e.g., MDS components) to a model that also includes PRS. This increase reflects the proportion of variance explained by genetic risk factors. Accuracy depends on trait heritability, SNP count, and discovery sample size, with a few thousand individuals typically sufficient for reliable estimates."

    "Both figures show that trait-associated SNPs in the base sample can predict the trait in the target sample. If the same trait is used, predictive power depends on the trait's heritability and base sample size. When using related but different traits, the predictive power also depends on their genetic correlation. Studies suggest that models with more lenient p-value thresholds capture smaller effects important for complex traits, while stricter thresholds reduce noise, aiding interpretation and the understanding of the underlying genetic architecture. Balancing informative SNPs and minimizing noise is key to maximizing predictive power.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "In this tutorial, we have discussed how to perform a simple polygenic risk score analysis using the PRSice script and interpret its results. As mentioned before, PRSice offers many additional options to adjust the risk score analysis, including adding covariates (principal components) and adjusting clumping parameters. It is recommended to read the user manual of PRSice to perform a polygenic risk score analysis optimal to the research question at hand.\n",

    "Now, you will need to do the same for a quantitative trait and explore the results.\n",

    "- Replication in (several) other cohorts provides convincing evidence\n",
    "- Applying stringent statistics (P<5e-8) helps to reduce the likelihood of false-positive results\n",
    "- An external reference panel can be used to improve LD estimation for clumping, providing more accurate definitions of LD blocks and refining the selection of variants for PRS analysis, especially when sample size is limited (e.g. ~500 samples).\n",
