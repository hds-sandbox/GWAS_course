	abstract = {Diversity serves as the foundation for breeding and evolution. In the science of genomics, the investigation of genetic variation has long been a prominent subject. Researchers now have access to previously unheard volumes of data, thanks to the development of new genomic technologies which allow them to thoroughly examine the complexity of genetic variation. As a result, new definitions and measurements of diversity have been created, taking into consideration things like how genetic variation is distributed throughout populations, the impact of natural selection, and the connection between genetic and phenotypic diversity. One crucial idea is "genetic ancestry" which describes the percentage of a person's genetic composition that may be linked to particular ancestral populations. Heterozygosity, which measures the degree of genetic variation within a population, is another crucial indicator of diversity. Recent developments in genomics have resulted in the creation of new tools and methodologies for examining the complexity of genetic variation in addition to these conventional diversity measurements. Generally, the area of diversity research is rapidly changing in the genomics age, with new theories and measures being created on a regular basis. The origins and effects of genetic variation are expected to continue to be revealed as our knowledge of genetic diversity deepens, with substantial ramifications for human health, evolutionary biology, and a variety of other domains.},

	abstract = {The Hardy–Weinberg principle is central to population genetics and evolutionary biology. It describes how allele and genotype frequencies are related, and that genetic variation can persist over multiple generations. Here, the historical origins and assumptions of the Hardy–Weinberg principle are described. Chi-square tests are used to find whether populations are at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, and departures from Hardy–Weinberg proportions can be due to genotyping error, non-random mating, natural selection, or other phenomena.},
