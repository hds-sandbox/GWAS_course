Here are the rendered notebooks for the webpage. Instructions for course developers:

- Develop the notebooks ONLY in `Notebooks` folder and run all the code in the notebooks you updated. 

- Then copy them here keeping the same folder structure (and copying new Images).

- Finally clear all cell outputs in the notebooks of the folder `Notebooks`, so they are not already rendered when students download them.

- Do not clear the cell outputs of the notebooks in this folder.
