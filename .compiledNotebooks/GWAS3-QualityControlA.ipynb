    "Overall, the SNP genotyping platform is very reliable and delivers stable results when it comes to determining genotypes. Of course, it is not flawless. One of the most frequent problems is that some of the SNPs are just not well-genotyped in the entire population. These should be removed to improve the overall data quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly, we can't remove every SNP with any missing values, as that would result in losing a significant portion of our data. Instead, we adopt some **thresholds**. However, determining these thresholds isn't governed by strict rules. You have the flexibility to set them within \"reasonable\" limits. To find out what constitutes \"reasonable,\" consulting relevant literature for your species of interest is advisable. For humans, a common starting point is a threshold of 0.2, meaning we exclude SNPs where 20% or more of the genotypes are missing in our population.\n",

    "## Missingness per individual\n",

    "The reliability of SNP chips is also high when it comes to individual genotypes. In some cases, however, some of the individuals contain a large number of missing SNPs. The reason could be low DNA sample quality, the wrong chip type used (e.g. cattle chip for deer samples), or other technical issues. Regardless of the reason, you should remove the worst offenders from your data set, to not compromise the overall quality of your results."

    "# Sex Discrepancy\n",
    "\n",
    "One useful check is verifying if the indicated sex is correct. Using PLINK, you can calculate the inbreeding coefficient on the X chromosome under the assumption that it is an autosomal chromosome. This approach is insightful because PLINK treats haploid chromosomes (like the X chromosome in males) as homozygotes due to technical reasons. Consequently, **assuming the X chromosome is autosomal makes males appear highly inbred on the X, whereas females do not** (since they have two X chromosomes). As a result, the inbreeding coefficient estimates will be close to 1 for males and 0 for females.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PLINK Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "This sex check can be performed in PLINK using the `--check-sex` option. The results are outputted in the file with extension `.sexcheck` (in the `Results/GWAS4` folder) in which the sex is in column `PEDSEX` (1 means male and 2 means female) and the inbreeding coefficient is in column `F`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, males should have an X chromosome homozygosity estimate >0.8 and females should have a value <0.2. So we could simply remove any individuals where the homozygosity estimate (F) does not match their specified sex. Subjects who do not fulfill these requirements are flagged `PROBLEM` by PLINK in the output file.\n",

In a population of e.g. 1000 individuals with the mentioned allele frequencies we expect to see 160 AA, 480 AB, and 360 BB individuals. Of course, we rarely see exact H-W distributions in real populations. The question then becomes, what is the difference between the expected H-W and observed proportions?

    "Almost all of our SNPs are in HWE, as determined by testing whether the alleles follow a binomial distribution. However, in our zoomed-in plot, we can spot a few extreme deviations. We can remove these outliers using the option `--hwe` in PLINK with the specified threshold. Note that `--hwe` filters only on controls, so if you want to apply the threshold to non-controls as well, add the `include-nonctrl` in the command. In the first step below, we filter controls using a threshold of `1e-6`, followed by filtering all phenotypes with a threshold `1e-10`:"

For example, when you apply the various filterings, create a new output name prefix instead of keeping use `mice`. Start from `mice`, then create `mice_miss`, `mice_miss_maf`, `mice_miss_maf_hwe`, `mice_miss_maf_hwe_het`, so that you can trace back all your work to each analysis step.\n",

    "| Step | Command | Function | Thresholds and explanation |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| 1: Missingness of SNPs | `--geno`| Excludes SNPs that are missing in a large proportion of the subjects. In this step, SNPs with low genotype calls are removed| We recommend first filtering SNPs and individuals based on a relaxed  threshold (0.2; >20%), as this will filter out SNPs and individuals  with very high levels of missingness. Then a filter with a more  stringent threshold can be applied (0.02)|\n",
    "| 2: Missingness of individuals | `--mind`| Excludes individuals who have high rates of genotype missingness. In this step, individuals with low genotype calls are removed | Note, SNP filtering should be performed before individual filtering |\n",
    "| 3: Sex discrepancy | `--check-sex`| Checks for discrepancies between the sex of the individuals recorded in the  dataset and their sex based on X chromosome heterozygosity/homozygosity  rates | Can indicate sample mix‐ups. If many subjects have this discrepancy, the data should be checked carefully. Males should have an X chromosome  homozygosity estimate >0.8 and females should have a value <0.2 |\n",
    "| 4: Minor allele frequency (MAF) | `--maf` | Includes only SNPs above the set MAF threshold| SNPs with a low MAF are rare, therefore power is lacking for detecting SNP‐phenotype associations. These SNPs are also more prone to genotyping errors.  The MAF threshold should depend on your sample size,  larger samples can use lower MAF thresholds. Respectively, for large (N = 100.000) vs. moderate samples (N = 10000),  0.01 and 0.05 are commonly used as MAF thresholds|\n",
    "| 5: Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) | `--hwe` | Excludes markers which deviate from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium | Common indicator of genotyping error, may also indicate evolutionary selection.  For binary traits, we suggest excluding: HWE p-value <1e−10 in cases and <1e−6 in controls. A less strict case threshold avoids discarding disease‐associated SNPs under selection.  For quantitative traits, we recommend HWE p-value <1e‐6. |\n",
    "| 6: Heterozygosity | `R` code + `--remove` option in PLINK | Excludes individuals with high or low heterozygosity rates | Deviations can indicate sample contamination and inbreeding.  We suggest removing individuals who deviate ±3 SD from the samples' heterozygosity rate mean |\n",
