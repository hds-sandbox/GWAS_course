    "2. Effect size $\\beta$; increasing the absolute value of effect size increases\n",

    "But let's first write down how these parameters and power are tied together.\n",

    "#### 3.2.1 Formulas for standard errors\n",
    "For the linear model\n",
    "$$y = \\mu + x\\beta + \\varepsilon,$$\n",
    "SE of $\\widehat{\\beta}$ is\n",
    "$$\\textrm{SE}_\\textrm{lin} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\textrm{Var}(x) n}} \\approx \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{2 f (1-f) n}},$$\n",

    "estimate of the mean-centered linear model: $\\textrm{Var}(\\widehat{\\beta})=\\sigma^2/ \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 .$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a typical QT-GWAS, the effects of variants on the total phenotypic variance are small (< 1%) and then we can\n",
    "assume that the error variance $\\sigma^2 \\approx \\textrm{Var}(y),$ which is 1 if the phenotype is processed\n",
    "by quantile normalisation or scaling of the residuals after regressing out the covariate effects.\n",

    "For *binary* case-control data analyzed by logistic regression,\n",

    "Thus, the difference to the linear model formula is that $\\sigma$ is replaced by 1\n",

    "\n",
    "Smaller SE means higher precision of the effect size estimate.\n",
    "Both of the formulas show how SE decreases with increasing sample size $n$,\n",
    "with increasing MAF $f$ and, for binary data, SE decreases as $\\phi$ gets closer\n",

    "These formulas work well for typical GWAS settings, but may not hold when\n",
    "some parameter ($n$ or $f$ or $\\phi(1-\\phi)$) gets close to zero.\n",
    "To know exactly when the formulas start to break down, it is best to do simulations.\n",
    "In particular, the formula may not be good for the rare variant testing ($f<0.001$).\n",
