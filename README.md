# GWAS with the Genomics Sandbox 

Repository for the GWAS with the genomics Sandbox. 

This course introduces and applies bioinformatic tools to perform a whole population genomics analysis. 

This workshop is based on the materials from: 
- "A tutorial on conducting genome-wide association studies: Quality control and statistical analysis": https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6001694/ 

Goals: 
- Learn and explain fundamental population genetics concepts, applying them during data analysis.
- Understand the principles of GWAS, including linkage disequilibrium and linear regression, and apply them in practice.
- Develop skills to preprocess data and perform genotype imputation for missing values.
- Explore, discuss, and replicate basic GWAS applications from the scientific literature.
- Interpret GWAS results critically, recognizing their limitations.

Syllabus: 
- Introduction to GWAS
- Quality control
- Population structure 
- Types of association tests
- Polygenic (risk) scores 
- Other applications 

Workshop requirements:

A basic understanding of R programming and Unix is strongly recommended, along with familiarity with genomic data, such as those generated from next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiments.
